Graph-Based Meaning Representations: Design and Processing
----------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial is on representing and processing _sentence meaning_
in the form of _labeled directed graphs_.
The tutorial will (a) briefly review relevant background in formal and
linguistic semantics; (b) semi-formally define a unified abstract view
on different flavors of semantic graphs and associated terminology;
(c) survey common frameworks for graph-based meaning representation
and available graph banks; and (d) offer a technical overview of a
representative selection of different parsing approaches.
